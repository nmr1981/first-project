# first-project

<-- This is my first project folder. My first personal project learning actual web dev.-->

Update your README.md file inside VS Code to add some text and then save the file. Run git status, and you should see that Git has tracked your changes and says the README.md file has been modified. This means your changes are ready to stage.
Stage the file using git add README.md, commit using git commit -m "update README.md", and then push to the remote using git push.
Refresh your browser on GitHub, and you should now see the updates you made to your README.md file showing on GitHub!
